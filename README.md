# Space Escape
## Mod 4 Solo Project
[Heather Faerber](https://github.com/hfaerber)

A simple Vue.js application using the Fetch API to retrieve data from Nasa's image of the day api and display all images for the current month with an option to return to the current day's image. The goal of this project was to build an application using a framework that I've never used/been taught: Vue.js.  

[See deployed application](https://hfaerber.github.io/space-escape/)

## Set Up  
Clone this repo to your local machine.  
Run `npm install vue`.
Open the index.html file.

## Challenges  
Following the recommendation of the Vue documentation, I opted for this very simple approach to my single-page application without using webpack or Vue CLI.  

This proved to be difficult as the majority of the documentation online applied to Vue CLI set up.  

When it came time to build a test suite, I realized that this simple approach would not allow for testing easily.  With the learning goals in mind, I've begun the process of migrating this simple application to [this Vue CLI repo](https://github.com/hfaerber/vue-cli-space-escape) and refactoring it to more appropriately use Vue components.  

Overall, Being able to navigate a foreign framework using only the documentation found online was challenging and exciting.  From initial set up, to overall architecture, to syntax...this project allowed for growth and learning through each of its challenges.
